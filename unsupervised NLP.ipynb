    "# Semantics\n",
    "An important part of speech is the semantics of words. When we teach a computer to recognize words, does it in fact recognize the concept or just memorize that exact word. Does it know how to relate the words to other ideas, as a human would? So far, no, so our models will get tripped up by things such as similes and homonyms (words spelled the same way but carry different meaning). For the similes, we could make a lemma (root word of a concept) for ideas, for example we could encode milady to be a lemma for lady, but we'd have to apply that to all the words in each use case scenario and we'd have to sift through the entire documents to make sure we got all of them. Not very feasible nor effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where unsupervised learning comes in. Instead of teaching the computer to understand every minute difference and relationship of words, we can run unsupervised models, neural nets in particular, in order to have the computer pick up on patterns in words that we feed it so it can learn itself. Then it can use those learned ideas on new sentences. Similar to supervised NLP, the unsupervised model is best fit on the data it was trained on. So if a model is trained on medical data, then it probably won't be effective on say identifying authors who wrote a novel based on the medical lexicon alone and vice versa. \n",

    "So far, the next section is gonna focus on Latent semantic analysis."

    "# Converting Sentences to Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The best Monty Python sketch is the one about the dead parrot,  I laughed so hard.\"\n",
    "2. \"I laugh when I think about Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch, it is funny, funny, funny, the best!\"\n",
    "3. \"Chocolate is the best ice cream dessert topping, with a great taste.\"\n",
    "4. \"The Lumberjack Song is the funniest Monty Python bit: I can't think of it without laughing.\"\n",
    "5. \"I would rather put strawberries on my ice cream for dessert, they have the best taste.\"\n",
    "6. \"The taste of caramel is a fantastic accompaniment to tasty mint ice cream.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a human being, it's easy to see that the sentences involve two topics, comedy and ice cream.   One way to represent the sentences is in a term-document matrix, with a column for each sentence and a row for each word.  Ignoring the stop words 'the', 'is','and', 'a', 'of,','I', and 'about,', discarding words that occur only once, and reducing words like 'laughing' to their root form ('laugh'), the term-document matrix for these sentences would be:\n",

    "|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",

    "\n",
    "For reference, 'document' in this case can refer to any form of text, whether that be a sentence, paragraph, or whole essays. Also in this case, the matric has the features of bag of words as rows and the sentences (observations) as columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above scenario, the word 'best' shows up in 4 of the 6 sentences and can refer to either topic, making it not so good at distinguishing between the ideas of comedy and ice cream. To avoid this, we have to weight words that show up often as lower as they don't contribute much information. We also want to weight words that show up only once as lower too as they probably don't provide a lot of information either and probably act as noise. We want that sweet spot in the middle so we can weight them higher as they are more indicative of the semantic nature of a topic. The word 'funny' shows up more often in the comedy sentences, making it a good choice as a word to pick out the comedy topic. "

We can accomplish this by creating unique weights for each sentence that combine the term frequency (how often a word appears within an individual document) with the idf, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tf-idf_{t,d}=(tf_{t,d})(idf_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the term 'funny' in sentence 2, where it occurs three times, will be weighted more heavily than the term 'funny' in sentence 1, where it only occurs once.  If 'best' had appeared multiple times in one sentence, it would also have a higher weight for that sentence, but the weight would be reduced by the idf term that takes into account that 'best' is a pretty common word in our collection of sentences.\n",
